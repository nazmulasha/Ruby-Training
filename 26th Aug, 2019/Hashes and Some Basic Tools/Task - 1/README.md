**Write a Ruby program that shows the current date and time at the beginning. Then takes a string of words and prints the word which has the maximum repeatations.
Write code in two different ways, one is using STL hash another one using no STL (maybe bruteforce) and print which one is faster.**<br>

**Sample Input:** *my code is my code, none of your code* <br>
**Sample Output:** *Champion: code (3 times) <br>
Bruteforce took: 19ms <br>
Hash took: 2ms <br>
verdict: Hash won* <br>
***you can assume that all the input characters will be lower-case roman characters***
