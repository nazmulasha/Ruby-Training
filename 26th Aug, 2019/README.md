#Day 2
**As we don't have much time, We are going a bit faster. Let's practice some deeper library functions and play with other neccessary stuffs of Ruby.
We will wrap up today or maybe tomorrow before evening and start learning Rails.**
*If you have any suggestions or want to practice more stuffs, please let me know*
