**-> aaamarr aamii = 3a1m1a2r 2a1m2i** <br>
***unluckily sometimes file size increases instead of decreasing. But still, let's honor this technique anyway. And we're going to write decompressor too.***<br>

**Input Output Format:**<br>
*you're going to work with files. Take any article from internet and save it as yourname_input.txt file. your source code will be yourname.rb and the compressed
