*We're aware of file compressing technique. In this task, we're going to compress text file. Compressing technique is goes like this below:**<br>
***-> aaamarr aamii = 3a1m1a2r 2a1m2i*** <br>
***unluckily sometimes file size increases instead of decreasing. But still, let's honor this technique anyway. And we're going to write decompressor too.***<br>

**Input Output Format:**<br>
*you're going to work with files. Take any article from internet and save it as **yourname_input.txt** file. your source code will be **yourname.rb** and the compressed 
output file will be **yourname_compressed.txt** and decompressed output will be **yourname_decompressed.txt**.*<br>
***your console should show a done message upon completion and show a verdict message showing File size is increased or decreased.***<br>

***This one is case sensitive, please be aware of that.***

***you must through exceptions if file is not acceesible ***
